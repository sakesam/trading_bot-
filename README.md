## Overview of the project and project goals

In a Jupyter notebook I Implemented an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions, Adjusted the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm, Trained a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model, Created an Evaluation Report



To complete the task the following steps were perfomed:

  - Establish a Baseline Performance

  - Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

  - Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier

Its always a very complicated question to make a decision which strategy is to implement. In this case first model seems like predicting an actual trend is better. In this section we see that first model project results closer to a actual ones, but classification report shows that the first one has slightly better quality of prediction. It must very well be likely, that first model is simply follows the first one, to make a decision I would further run one more version of the model to make sure my prediction is correct.
